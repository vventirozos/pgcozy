pgcozy
=========

pgcozy is an extension who adds the capability to keep snapshots of the buffer cache and later can prewarm according to these snapshots.
Snapshots are saved in jsonb format under a schema and a table and they can be reviewed , backed up or transferred
Also see my blog for some examples and tips: 

INSTALLATION
------------

Requirements: pg_preworm and pg_buffercache extensions

In directory where you downloaded pgcozy to run

    make
    make install

Log into PostgreSQL and run the following commands. 

    CREATE EXTENSION pgcozy;
	select pgcozy_init();

This will create a schema called pgcozy , a table called snapshots and a type called cozy_type.
This extension uses pg_prewarm and pg_buffercache to read the contents of shared buffers and store them for later prewarm.

UPGRADE
-------

Make sure all the upgrade scripts for the version you have installed up to the most recent version are in the $BASEDIR/share/extension folder. 

    ALTER EXTENSION pgcozy UPDATE TO '<latest version>';

For detailed change logs of each version, please see the top of each update script.
